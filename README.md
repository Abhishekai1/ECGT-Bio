# ECGT-Bio: Explainable Counterfactual Graph Transformer for Biomedical Discovery

> **Status**: Research Prototype â€” Designed for publication in top-tier AI/ML venues (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR, AAAI, ICML).

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**ECGT-Bio** is a **novel AI framework** that fuses **graph neural networks**, **causal inference**, and **domain-specific knowledge** to enable *explainable, counterfactual reasoning* over **biomedical knowledge graphs**.

Unlike conventional link prediction models, ECGT-Bio is built to:
- **Predict** new biomedical relationships (drugâ€“disease, geneâ€“phenotype, proteinâ€“interaction).
- **Explain** *why* the prediction is made, using subgraph evidence.
- **Simulate interventions** â€” *What if this gene was silenced? What if a drug targeted a different pathway?*
- **Quantify uncertainty**, enabling trust in high-stakes biomedical applications.

## ðŸš€ Research Contributions

1. **Graph Transformer Backbone**  
   A heterogeneous Graph Transformer with attention-based multi-relation message passing.

2. **Counterfactual Reasoning Module**  
   `do()`-style interventions for causal simulation of biomedical scenarios.

3. **Uncertainty-Aware Predictions**  
   Outputs calibrated confidence intervals using heteroscedastic modeling.

4. **Neuro-Symbolic Rule Integration**  
   Embeds biomedical knowledge constraints directly into the loss function.

5. **Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM)**  
   Ensures robustness across dataset shifts and experimental biases.

## ðŸ§ª Applications
- **Drug Repurposing**: Identify unexpected drugâ€“disease links.
- **Genetic Target Discovery**: Explore therapeutic targets through simulated knockouts.
- **Clinical Trial Prioritization**: Rank candidates with explainable evidence and uncertainty scores.
